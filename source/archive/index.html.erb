<blockquote>
This volume does not aspire to the name of an autobiography. It relates a variety of isolated circumstances in which I have taken partâ€”some of them arranged in the order of time, and others grouped together in separate chapters, from similarity of subject.

The selection has been made in some cases from the importance of the matter. In others, from the celebrity of the persons concerned ; whilst several of them furnish interesting illustrations of human character.
