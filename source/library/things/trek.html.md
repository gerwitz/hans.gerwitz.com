In 2000 I replaced a stolen Trek 7000 with a brand-spankin'-new [2001 Trek 8000][1].  My reasoning was that having an expensive bike would encourage me to actually use it, and get in shape.  It didn't work until 2003, but that year I rode several centuries on that bike, starting a cycling team and seriously improved my fitness while recruiting friends to do the same.  I rewarded myself with a [more appropriate pavement bike][2].  
As of this writing the 8000 is collecting dust the basement, but I'd like to return it to active duty for some off-road riding, even if just curb-jumping through the city.  
â€¦and in 2008 I sold it on Craigslist for a paltry $300 as part of the pre-Seattle purge.
