<h2>Work</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://theartificial.com/">The Artificial</a> is strong but not growing. Getting larger would require recruiting a director who can lead teams and consult as well as opening another anchor client, so we'll be steady for a while.

</p>

<h2>Home</h2>
<p>
  Finding suitable contractors here is hard, even with the help of our office manager who is a native Amsterdammer.
</p>
<p>
  Simply turning on a Hue bulb from a normal light switch means the house needs a brain. I'm testing Home Assistant on a Synology NAS, which may lead to much bigger projects.
</p>

<h2>Cyberspace</h2>
<p>
  My excursions into micropub have led to building my own bridge from that API to this static site. Of course I couldn't just make do and ended up building <a href="https://sitewriter.net/">Sitewriter</a> for this. It's still quiet but there are actual users and that makes it exciting.
