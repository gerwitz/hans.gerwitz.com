<h2>Work</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://theartificial.com/">The Artificial</a> is strong but not growing. Getting larger would require recruiting a director who can lead teams and consult as well as opening another anchor client, so we'll be steady for a while.
</p>
<p>
  (<a href="https://theartificial.com/search/?q=weeknotes">Weeknotes on the blog</a> might offer more frequent updates.)
</p>

<h2>Home</h2>
<p>
  There are a lot of little rehab projects underway, but those are mostly via contractors.
</p>
<p>
  Simply turning on a Hue bulb from a normal light switch means the house needs a brain. I'm still deciding between OpenHAB and Home Assistant.
</p>

<h2>Cyberspace</h2>
<p>
  At work I need to set up some inter-site updates, so I'm using this as a prompt to learn more about <a href="http://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>, where everything old is new again. Starting with Micropub on this site and joining <a href="https://micro.blog/about">Micro.blog</a>.
