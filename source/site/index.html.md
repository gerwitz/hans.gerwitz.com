## What's with the ‚¥≤?

The circled cross is an ancient astronomy symbol for Earth. I am fond of Earth.

It's also used for [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), which tickles my fancy as a fan of Boolean algebra and matrix mathematics.

Of course, there are [many other meanings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_cross) in various cultures. As such, it appears several times in Unicode:

- [U+2A01](https://unicode-table.com/en/2A01/): N-ary circle plus operator (‚®Å)
- [U+2295](https://unicode-table.com/en/2295/): circled plus (‚äï)
- [U+2D32](https://unicode-table.com/en/2D32/): Tifinagh letter yabh (‚¥≤)
- [U+1F728](https://unicode-table.com/en/1F728/): alchemical symbol for verdigris (üú®)

## Who else is making this work?

[Google Analytics][goog] is used for usage tracking and may drop a cookie on you. I've set my account to [not share tracking data][ua], but you have no way to validate that and I have no way to confirm that Google honors this setting.

Other external resources are referenced, including [Twitter's][twttr] scripts for explicit pop-ups and jQuery from [their CDN][jquery]. On the [homepage](/) a [Flickr][] script is loaded which insists on loading a Yahoo geolocation script as well as requested assets. None of these should be using this to track you, but my control is limited so YMMV.
