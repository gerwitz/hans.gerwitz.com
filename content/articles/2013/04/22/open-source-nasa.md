NASA has been refining [a new "lander" platform](http://www.nasa.gov/roboticlander/) for use on the Moon and asteroids. It's the space-grade version of the quadracopter drones that are popular among hobbyists and technology observers these days, powered by hydrogen peroxide thrusters.

It's fun that they've named it Mighty Eagle after [an Angry Birds feature](http://angrybirds.wikia.com/wiki/Mighty_Eagle), but more noteworthy is [the adoption of ArduCopter by the Marshall Space Flight Center](http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/nasa-using-arducopter).
