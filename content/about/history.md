title: History

My first Internet home was [Nyx](http://www.nyx.net/history.html), and in 1994 they let us host userpages. So I established my first web presence, with animated GIFs.
In 1995 I registered phobia.com, and in 1996 put a site up on [Brick](http://brick.net/).[^phobia] Even after gainful employment replaced "phobia consulting", I used the site as a personal homepage until in 2003 I decided to [call it a blog](/2003/03/14/first-post.html).  

That same year, I started using [iBlog](iBlog /2003/04/21/iblog.html) to publish in a structured way, but being a server-side web architect, I was eager to try new tools. After [flirting with blojsam](/2003/05/29/phonetic-nightmares.html), I settled on [SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/space/phobia) mostly because it was growing to support Groovy, and I was newly interested in Ruby](/2003/05/28/scripting.html) which wasn't very mature for web work yet.  
After two years I migrated to XWiki briefly but in 2006 [gave in to the Wordpress hegemony](/2006/04/10/wordpress-it-is.html).

Ringing in 2007, I sold the domain name and [moved to this more personal hostname](/2007/01/20/fearless.html).[^si] Wordpress served me well enough, but when I was [fireballed](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/08/31/gerwitz) in 2010 it just couldn't handle the load (on memory) and my site spent most of the day unable to respond.

Caching and optimizing made me comfortable for a while, but that Ruby itch finally got too strong and in 2012 I [switched to nanoc](/2012/02/20/reset.html).

More information about the history of this site can be found in [meta posts](/archive/categories/meta.html).

  [^phobia]: Inspired by [Philip Greenspun](http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/server-programming) on photo.net, I had picked up [PHP/FI](http://www.php.net/manual/en/history.php.php) and built sites in the late 1990s. My favorite client was [Crown Candy](http://crowncandykitchen.net/), who bartered for meals and chocolate.

  [^si]: I still felt the need for a "brand" of some sort, and soon began using [safelyignored.com][].  In late 2009 I finally accepted the value of a [unique name][] and have embraced it online.
