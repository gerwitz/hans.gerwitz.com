title: Fur monsters
---

In [February 2011][blog], I taught myself [Processing][] by building this guy.  I'm sure there are many optimizations available, starting with existing particle libraries, but figuring out the fur from scratch was most of the fun.

I don't expect it to be of value to others, but source can be found at [OpenProcessing][].
