> Unreason and anti-intellectualism abominate thought. Thinking implies disagreement; and disagreement implies nonconformity; and nonconformity implies heresy; and heresy implies disloyalty — so, obviously, thinking must be stopped. But shouting is not a substitute for thinking and reason is not the subversion but the salvation of freedom.

> A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.

Questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point: design is inevitable. The alternative to good design is bad design, not no design at all.

With respect to the theological view of the question; this is always painful to me.--I am bewildered.--I had no intention to write atheistically. But I own that I cannot see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent & omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed. On the other hand I cannot anyhow be contented to view this wonderful universe & especially the nature of man, & to conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion _at all_ satisfies me .... But the more I think the more bewildered I become; as indeed I have probably shown by this letter.

It is incumbent on us diligently to remember that the kingdom of heaven was promised to the poor in spirit, and that minds afflicted by calamity and the contempt of mankind cheerfully listen to the divine promise of future happiness; while, on the contrary, the fortunate are satisfied with the possession of this world; and the wise abuse in doubt and dispute their vain superiority of reason and knowledge.

### Calvin (& Hobbes)

> 
Why should I have to WORK for everything?! It's like saying I don't deserve it!

> 
I must obey the inscrutable exhortations of my soul."

> 
Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.
Bill Watterson, [Calvin and Hobbes, November 8, 1989][55]  
   [55]: http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1989/11/08/

> 
I hate to think that all my current experiences will someday become stories with no point.
Bill Watterson, [Calvin and Hobbes, May 25, 1995][56]  
   [56]: http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/05/25/

> 
Do you hate being a girl? What's it like? Is it like being a bug?
I imagine bugs and girls have a dim perception that nature played a cruel trick on them, but they lack the intelligence to comrehend the magnitude of it.

> 
I don't need to compromise my principles, because they don't have the slightest bearing on what happens to me anyway.

> 
Oh, great altar of passive entertainment… Bestow upon me thy discordant images at such speed as to render linear thought impossible!

> 
In my opinion, we don't devote nearly enough scientific research to finding a cure for jerks.

> 
There's no problem so awful that you can't add some guilt to it and make it even worse!

> 
So the secret to good self-esteem is to lower your expectations to the point where they're already met?

> 
When I grow up, I'm not going to read the newspaper and I'm not going to follow complex issues and I'm not going to vote. That way I can complain when the government doesn't represent me. Then, when everything goes down the tubes, I can say the system doesn't work and justify my further lack of participation.

> 
You know how people are. They only recognize greatness when some authority confirms it.

> 
History is the fiction we invent to persuade ourselves that events are knowable and that life has order and direction. That's why events are always reinterpreted when values change. We need new versions of history to allow for our current prejudices.

> 
As far as I'm concerned, if something is so complicated that you can't explain it in 10 seconds, then it's probably not worth knowing anyway.

Bill Watterson, [Calvin and Hobbes, January 6, 1989][57]

People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don't realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in the world.
